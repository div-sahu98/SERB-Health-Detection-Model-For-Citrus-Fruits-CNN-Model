A Deep Network Based Health Detection Model For Citrus Fruits  Abstract - One of the most significant factors is the quality evaluation of agricultural products in supporting their marketability and controlling waste management. To classify the fruits into healthy and defected class, deep learning algorithms have been implemented to perform citrus disease detection. This study aims to use the dense CNN algorithm to detect and provide an effective method for detecting the apparent defects of citrus fruit. Citrus fruit images are collected and put in two classes of good and damaged ones, to recognize and categorize the image dataset.
